There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb N steps at a time.

Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. 
 
The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2

Complete a method to link StepDO Domain objects together (DefaultNodeServiceImpl.createSteps). 

Complete a method that traverses the StepDOs to determine the permutations (DefaultRequestServiceImpl. ).
